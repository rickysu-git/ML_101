# ML101_walkthrough

This repo has a few vanilla examples of machine learning algorithms run on the IRIS dataset.

1. Download Python >=3.7
2. Clone this repo to your local. `cd` into it.
3. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. `jupyter-notebook`

Note: `tensorflow` is buggy on Mac Catalina, please keep in mind you `might` have to Google some stuff to fix your setup if something breaks.

Macs should be able to run Jupyter notebooks without an issue.
